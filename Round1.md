## Day 1 - December 7th, 2017
Today I worked on adding the form to allow users to add a restaurant to a list of matches. It currently is failing and needs to figure out how access the profile model and just update the existing user in the database. After accessing the list of restaurants it then needs to iterate through the top 10 and load them into the matches page.

*Slow progress, more tomorrow*

## Day 2 - December 8th, 2017
I worked on implementing the relational part of the model to display matches for the user. I now understand how to add an object however I need direction on how to pass and object through a form or something so the user can see exactly which restaurants they are matched with.

*Medium progress, more tomorrow*

## Day 3 - December 9th, 2017
Continued progress on models and briefly touched on display.

## Day 4 - December 10th, 2017
Today I got a lot done. I implemented a ID system for the restaurants in order to maintain a unique ID for URL making and increasing the ease in which you can access your matches. In the future I plan to pass the ID through in order to add the match to the User's list. Great progress today and will pick up tomorrow.

*Good progress, more tomorrow*
