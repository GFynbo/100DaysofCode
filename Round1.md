## Day 1 - December 7th, 2017
Today I worked on adding the form to allow users to add a restaurant to a list of matches. It currently is failing and needs to figure out how access the profile model and just update the existing user in the database. After accessing the list of restaurants it then needs to iterate through the top 10 and load them into the matches page.

*Slow progress, more tomorrow*

## Day 2 - December 8th, 2017
I worked on implementing the relational part of the model to display matches for the user. I now understand how to add an object however I need direction on how to pass and object through a form or something so the user can see exactly which restaurants they are matched with.
